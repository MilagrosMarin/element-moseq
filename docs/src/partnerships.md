# Key partnerships

Element MoSeq was developed in collaboration with the [Keypoint-MoSeq developers](https://github.com/dattalab/keypoint-moseq), particularly with Kai Fox from Datta's Lab at Harvard Medical School, to foster integration and interoperability between Keypoint-MoSeq and the DataJoint Element MoSeq.
