# Element MoSeq

DataJoint Element for Motion Sequencing with 
[Keypoint-MoSeq](https://github.com/dattalab/keypoint-moseq){:target="_blank"}, 
from keypoint data extracted with [DeepLabCut](x){:target="_blank"}. DataJoint Elements collectively standardize and automate
data collection and analysis for neuroscience experiments. Each Element is a modular
pipeline for data storage and processing with corresponding database tables that can be
combined with other Elements to assemble a fully functional pipeline.
